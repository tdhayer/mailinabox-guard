# Contributing

Mail-in-a-Box Guard is an open-source project. Your contributions and pull requests are welcome.

## Development

To start developing Mail-in-a-Box Guard, [clone the repository](https://github.com/tdhayer/mailinabox-guard) and familiarize yourself with the code.

    $ git clone https://github.com/tdhayer/mailinabox-guard

### Vagrant and VirtualBox

We recommend you use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for local development. Please install them first.

With Vagrant set up, the following should boot up Mail-in-a-Box Guard inside a virtual machine:

    $ vagrant up --provision

_If you're seeing an error message about your *IP address being listed in the Spamhaus Block List*, simply uncomment the `export SKIP_NETWORK_CHECKS=1` line in the `Vagrantfile`. It's normal, as you're likely using a dynamic IP address assigned by your Internet provider._

### Modifying your `hosts` file

After a while, Mail-in-a-Box Guard will be available at `192.168.56.4` (unless you changed that in your `Vagrantfile`). To be able to use the web interface, we recommend adding a hostname to your `hosts` file:

    $ echo "192.168.56.4 mailinabox.lan" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

You should now be able to navigate to https://mailinabox.lan/admin using your browser. There should be an initial admin user with the name `me@mailinabox.lan` and the password `12345678`.

### Making changes

Your working copy of Mail-in-a-Box Guard will be mounted inside your VM at `/vagrant`. Any change you make locally will appear inside your VM automatically.

Running `vagrant up --provision` again will repeat the installation with your modifications.

Alternatively, you can also ssh into the VM using:

    $ vagrant ssh

Once inside the VM, you can re-run individual parts of the setup:

    vm$ cd /vagrant
    vm$ sudo setup/management.sh # replace with script you'd like to re-run

### Tests

Writing and contributing tests is a great start if you are looking for a way to help improve codebase stability.
